I am Ömer. I love using computers and have been using them for many years. I have previous experience with coding. Coding has been my childhood dream.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; Iwill be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; 
I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understant that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, 
it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office houes.
